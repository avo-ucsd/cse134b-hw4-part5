FromSoftware's first foray into open world design is a triumph. Elden Ring combines the studio's signature challenging combat with the freedom of exploration.

The world of the Lands Between is vast and filled with secrets. Every corner hides something interesting, whether it's a hidden boss, a new weapon, or lore that deepens the story.

The difficulty is still punishing, but the open world structure means you can always go explore somewhere else if you get stuck.

Boss design is top tier, with some of the most memorable fights in any Souls game.

A few performance issues on certain platforms, but the core experience is exceptional.
